# Assistant Toolkit API ðŸš€

This is a FastAPI-based API for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) assistant. It uses LlamaIndex to connect a language model with documents and chat history stored in MongoDB.

This project was created for a YouTube tutorial demonstrating how to build and deploy a modern RAG API.

## Features
- **Dynamic Retrieval:** Uses a custom retriever for hybrid search (vector + keyword) on MongoDB.
- **Chat Memory:** Integrates with Redis for short-term conversation memory.
- **Modular Design:** Built with a clean service layer and dependency injection for scalability.
